### Purpose and usefulness

When designing your tool, you do it for certain purpose. You can adjust your tool by assigning usefulness to certain attributes, with this you can:
- make better tools than manually choosing jewels
- make tools faster than by manually choosing jewels
- easily decide which jewels are not worth keeping and automatically recycle them

Jewel Purposer remembers purposes that you added to it

### Tutorial

1. craft jewel purposer (use jei)
2. put your jewels inside (works with hoppers)
3. create new purpose with "+" or navigate to existing one with '<' and '>' buttons
4. insert your tool
5. configure attributes to perfect your tool
- '/' divides value by 10
- 'Ã—' multiplies value by 10
- '+' adds 1 to value
- '-' subtracts 1 from value
6. click hammer to apply jewels
7. take back your tool

### Cutting and recycling

!! RIGHT NOW, THIS IGNORES JEWELER EXPERTISE AND NEITHER PRODUCES NOR CONSUMES ANY RESOURCES. Because of that, these features should be disabled by default, enable with gamerules vaultJpAllowCutting and vaultJpAllowRecycling \
\
Jewel purposer can automatically cut and recycle jewels. \
All jewels below "Usefulness limit" for **all** purposes will be recycled. \
All jewels with unspent free cuts will be cut.
